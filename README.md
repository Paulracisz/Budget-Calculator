# Budget-Calculator
    You are in charge of making a budgeting app to calculate how to budget a paycheck into three different percentages. Given the integer 'paycheck' you are going to create a function that takes the number and splits it into 20% for wants, 40% for needs, and 40% for investments. 
        EXAMPLE:
        paycheck = $242.62

        WANTS (20%) = $48.52
        NEEDS (40%) = $97.04
        INVESTMENTS (40%) = 97.04

    Your final answer should be in the following format

    "Wants : $int"
    "Needs : $int"
    "Investments : $int"

    Where int is the number, converted into a string format.
